Description of your project
---------------------------

As schools around the world respond to the “new normal”, the need for remote learning tools has never been more urgent. We present a solution that can help schools, educators, students, and their families to make the transition to distance learning easier.
We Developed pseudo distance learning applications or online educational tools for remote learning that allow users to interact and a “classroom-like” environment.

Some Features: 

1) Users can register as students, Teachers, or Parents.
2) Virtual study group — Students can meet up on a common forum and prepare for their exams along with other students that are studying for the same subject matter.
3) Provide users with study material, tools, discussion helps guides, etc.
4)Parents can check the notice board for any announcement (like snow/rainy day holidays, reports cards, fee due dates, attendance as well as upcoming school events) rather than communicating via email.
5)Parents/Teachers can upload photos, videos and other files that they may feel are important for children’s education.
